3. CHECK TIME CONVERSIONS AGAIN

5. Test 1 800 200 200. The philosopher should not eat and should die.  ---> means that there is an monitoring thread, checking for potential death??

make a separate thread that checks the death condition

6. init monitor thread to check each phil's
	- death state (check time in several places in phil routine)
	- time_eaten

maybe problem with timestamps/ print 

1. SPECIAL CASE FOR 1 PHIL
